Worked on this homework with Baylor Hinshaw

This is a quiz that beings when you press "Begin Quiz" button. It has 6 questions and  a max time limit of 60 seconds. the object is to get a high score, but theres a twist. if you get an answer wrong you get 5 seconds deduced from the time. At the end you enter your name and your score will be logged

Working on this homework was REALLY HARD. I tried to figure this out on my own, but it just wouldnt work no matter what i tried. The hardest part for me was trying to get the start button to show after i put the css style "hide". Than to get my questions to display.
